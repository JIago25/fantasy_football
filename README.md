TBD model of correlation and distributions of expectations versus performance

# Where does a player start off the regular season, perception-wise and how do they perform on those expectations

Make exceptions for injuries and suspensions.  Examples below..

# How big of an impact does the team's wins have on expected points per game?

# Does externalities like weather or bye weeks have strong correlations to performance?

# What statistics might predict a breakout performance of relatively unknown players?
